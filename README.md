1. Project Summary 

Site Chosen: Kehler Vegetable Company farm market 

Current URL: (https://www.kehlervegetables.ca/) 

Client Needs: The client’s current website lacks modern design elements and may have accessibility issues, particularly with Instagram integration. An update could improve user experience and better reflect the brand's message of fresh, local produce. 

Primary Purpose: The main goal of the website is to inform the local community about the farm’s products, location, and hours, promoting a sense of trust and connection to the farm. 

Target Audience: 

• Local community members seeking fresh, locally grown produce and eggs 

• Potential visitors to the farm 

• Health-conscious consumers who prioritize non-GMO products 

Key Messages: 

• Freshness and quality of produce 

• Commitment to non-GMO and sustainable practices 

• A trustworthy, locally focused, small family farm 

Calls to Action: 

• Visit the farmstand 

• Follow on social media for updates 

• Use the contact options for inquiries about produce availability 

Current Site Limitations: 

• Instagram feed does not load, which might affect user engagement 

• The design could be more modern and user-friendly, with an improved layout, accessibility, and responsiveness
